Discussion: In Experiment-1 I used 6 layers, 0.01 learning rate, Relu Activation Function and got 10.31 % accuracy. I got less accuracy in Experiment 1 because there were 6 layers and the model trained over fitted.  After trying with different parameters, I got best accuracy using 2 hidden layers, 0.001 learning rate and Tanh activation function. The accuracy is 79.56%. 


Loss vs Iteration graph of experiment 1 for First Dataset is given below:

For dataset 1: 
In Experiment-1 I used 6 layers, 0.01 learning rate, Relu Activation Function and got 10.31 % accuracy. I got less accuracy in Experiment 1 because there were 6 layers and the model trained over fitted.  After trying with different parameters, I got best accuracy using 2 hidden layers, 0.001 learning rate and Tanh activation function. The accuracy is 79.56%. 

For dataset 2: 
I used same parameters for experiment 1 and got 87.03% accuracy and for same parameters of experiment 2, I got 89.5% accuracy. The result is almost same for different parameters.
